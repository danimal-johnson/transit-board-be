# Motivation for the project

[Back to readme](../readme.md)

## Justification

1. The county transit website (LTD) is helpful for finding the best route to a new location, but too cumbersome to navigate for regularly-traveled routes (like your daily commute).
2. The current transit app (Umu) is a bit better at checking times, but not nearly as convenient as a quick glance.
3. The paper or PDF version of the printed schedule is much harder to manage. Time tables fill multiple pages. PM times are only differentiated by a slightly-bolder typeface - really hard to discern when flipping pages. It's easy to look up AM when you mean PM, etc.
4. A functional bus departure display would be really cool to have at my house!

## Use Cases

### Leaving the house

- My house is a 15-minute walk to the bus station with buses spaced up to 30 minutes apart.
- I want to know when I should leave to catch the next bus on time.
  - (Do I need to rush out the door in a full panic? Do I have time to go back and grab the thing I forgot? If I miss it, can I take the next bus and still be OK?)
- Looking through the printed schedule or navigating the website takes too long.
- I would like a physical display, web app, or widget to tell me the next times quickly.

### Heading home

- Bus service is 30 minutes apart. The last bus leaves at different times on weekdays, Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays. It's easy to miss the last bus because I am looking at the wrong schedule.
- Missing the last bus means a 2-hour walk home.
- I would like to look at an app on my phone to see a billboard-like display of next departure times, and the time of the last departure of the day.

### Hobbyists and makers

- Lowers the bar for web developers to create front-end apps
- Allows tinkerers and makers to create standalone displays using cheap hardware
- Artists can add their own creative touches to designs
- No subscription services are required
